## Article about Career Development as a Software Engineer

#### The article below is an interview with Lindsey Redd who has worked with several big tech companies such as Slack, Lyft and Stripe. She talks about what her job entails and advice and information for how potential softwar engineers can develop their career. She doesn't only talk about her work life but also talks about how classes were like in college and how she landed internships while she was in college. I like this article because it provides helpful information to students who are seeking to become software engineers. She also mentions how to prepare for interviews, so it is worth reading for anyone who is preparing to get a job in the industry.
